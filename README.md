# nextflow_patterns

This repo documents nextflow patterns that we at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute have found to be useful. Note: any use of these are done at your own risk.

Note: for our analysis we use Saga, the [Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/) HPC resource. Some things will be specific to using that resource.
